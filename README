Design Goals
- Safe:
  Syntax independent of variables content. Well-defined data structure.
  Spaces in variable, quotes, escaping.
  Check that all executables are there before even starting.
- Easy:
  Mix Python and Bash freely. Solve each task with the best suited
  language.
- Powerful:
  All the power of Python for logic and of Bash for system
  interaction.
- Readable: Avoid quotes and escaping hell.
- Simple:
  Single file, no-dependencies compiler. On-the-fly or pre-compiled to
  pure Python.
